				This is the webpage for the 2022 edition of the WINGs retreat. The webpage for the 2023 edition can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbar/wings.html">here</a>.

				<p style="font-size:20px"><b>Description</b></p>
				<p> WINGs 2022 was the second instalment of an annual retreat for women, and other underrepresented genders, in number theory and geometry. It was aimed at early career mathematicians, from PhD onwards. Events included social activities, which encouraged interaction between participants, and short talks, so that participants could learn about each otherâ€™s research interests. Our aim was to counteract the isolation which can be experienced by female mathematicians during their career by fostering a sense of community from the start.</p>

				<p> The retreat took place in person from the 6th to the 8th of June at <a href="https://westlexham.org/"> West Lexham</a>, Norfolk. Here is the conference photo:

				<!---<p style="font-size:20px"><b>Registration</b></p>
				
				<p> There will be no registration fee for the retreat. All attendees will have their accomodation and sustenance provided and UK based participants will have their travel costs reimbursed.</p>

				<p> Registration is now closed. We'd like to thank all applicants for their interest. Places will be allocated so that there is a balance of research interests and we will email you by the end of April to confirm if you have been offered a place. </p>
